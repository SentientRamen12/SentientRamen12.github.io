            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Shubham Rastogi, a passionate software developer with a diverse background, committed to
                leveraging technology to create impactful solutions. Growing up in Indonesia as an Indian, I developed a
                unique perspective on how technology can empower communities and drive economic growth. My love for
                exploring cultures and people through food, architecture, and meaningful interactions has shaped my
                worldview and approach to problem-solving.</p>

            <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
            <p>My professional journey began at <strong>Pingal Technologies</strong>, where I engineered real-time
                customer tracking solutions using advanced ML techniques. At <strong>Undostres</strong>, I developed
                database and logging layers for a Wallet as a Service product, enabling multi-tenant capabilities. My
                next significant role was at <strong>Ula</strong>, a Sequoia-funded startup in Indonesia, where I led a
                team to build critical social commerce features, enhancing our platform's capabilities and significantly
                increasing app usage and monthly GMV. Previously, at <strong>Wadhwani AI</strong>, I lead the
                development
                of AI-based solutions for social impact, focusing on assessing and remedying Indic language fluency in
                public schools across India. This role has allowed me to scale solutions and reduce infrastructure costs
                while expanding our reach.</p>
            <p>In addition to my professional roles, I pursued a B.Tech in Computer Engineering with a minor in Machine
                Learning and Distributed Systems at <strong>Delhi Technological University</strong>, followed by an M.S.
                in Computer Science at <strong>New York University</strong>, where I continue to deepen my expertise and
                knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
            <p>With a strong foundation in software development, I have honed my skills in a variety of programming
                languages, including C++, Python, Golang, and Typescript (Node.js). My expertise extends to databases
                such as MySQL, Postgres, BigQuery, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and Redis, and I am proficient in frameworks
                like FastAPI, Django, React, Springboot, and GraphQL. My experience with technologies such as Docker,
                Kubernetes, Kafka, and AWS/GCP has enabled me to build scalable and efficient solutions. I excel in
                creating robust data pipelines, optimizing infrastructure, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver
                impactful projects.</p>

            <h3>Motivations</h3>
            <p>My journey has been driven by a profound curiosity and passion for exploring technology and its
                real-world applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and creating solutions that make a
                tangible impact. Currently, I am motivated by the potential to bring social impact through my technical
                skills, particularly in education and community empowerment. I believe in the power of technology to
                bridge gaps, create opportunities, and drive positive change.</p>

            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>Outside of work, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired and engaged. I love cooking and
                experimenting with different cuisines, enjoying the ritual of making and savoring good coffee, and
                playing board games with friends and family. Music is a constant companion, and traveling allows me to
                explore new cultures and ideas. I am also passionate about learning new things and enjoy discussing
                potential startup ideas, always on the lookout for the next big challenge.</p>
